👻 Turn a MacBook Air (M1) into a dev machine.

My setup is powered by Homebrew and `zsh` as the shell. 

## Setup

1. Move the `.zhsrc` and the `Brewfile` to your home directory.
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
3. Run `brew bundle` to install all the required software through Homebrew.
4. Change your default shell to `zsh`, as covered [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/change-the-default-shell-trml113/mac).
